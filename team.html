                            <p>Rishi Ajmera is currently a high school senior from Eastern Massachusetts. Rishi’s initiative and concern about the
                            barriers and inequality within education led him to found and run the organization. Rishi’s passion stemmed from his
                            keen interests in math and his private tutoring sessions that he did within his local community. He taught students as
                            young as pre- k all the way till 8th grade, ranging from basic addition and abstraction to SAT math problems. Seeing
                            students excited to learn and excellinging in their subject as a result, left Rishi satisfied and wanting to continue
                            teaching. However, he realized how many students don’t get the opportunity of private tutoring often due to a multitude
                            of factors like cost. This led to him to create Silverline Tutoring, a non profit organization that offers free tutoring
                            to everyone regardless of background. As for the experience on the business side of the organization, Rishi has lots of
                            experience within this field. He competes in DECA, an international business competition, and this year he competed in
                            the event, entrepreneurship, qualifying all the way to the international stage. The previous year, Rishi competed in the
                            event, principles of marketing, and qualified for states. Rishi is the president of his school's finance club as well
                            which focuses on many aspects of personal finance such as stocks. Rishi's experience within business has allowed him to
                            excel in the business side of operations of the organization.</p>

                            <p>Tarun is currently a rising high school junior in Eastern Massachusetts. His interest in tutoring as well as development allowed him to fit in at Silverline as the technology head. Tarun’s passion in tutoring mainly came after running math workshops for the NSF foundation where he taught 1st - 5th graders the basics of competition math in anticipation of an upcoming exam. From such experiences, he was left with a rewarding feeling that instilled his passion for teaching. Today, he continues to volunteer for such organizations and works as a teacher. On the technology side, Tarun has been featured on NBC Boston for his work in assisting small businesses in his area with web applications. After the main wave of Covid-19, Tarun saw that smaller businesses were severely disadvantaged and suffering. As a result, he started an initiative through a social media campaign to attract small business owners. The post blew up, and in the end, he assisted a total of 7 businesses in his area. Additionally, in the past, he’s functioned as a junior developer for a startup called “Sujalam” that worked to provide water tracking functionality to shrimp farmers. Specifically, he worked on app authentication via Firebase. His years of experience in the computer science field and passion for helping others have allowed him to thrive as the technology head of Silverline Tutoring Services.</p>

                            <p>Hassan Palanpurwala is currently a rising senior in South Florida. Hassans urbane attitude, passion for helping others,
                            and organization allowed him to fit in as the marketing head at Silverline Tutoring. Hassan’s passion for helping others
                            came at a young age when he struggled with speaking English at school. Hassans first language was Gujarati, and when he
                            started school he didn't know how to communicate with others. However, with the help of his parents and others around
                            him, he was left feeling fulfilled and confident in school and wanted to help others feel this way. Hassan became very
                            active in his community by starting book drives, helping tutor kids, and working with local schools to bring speech and
                            debate to schools with less resources. These goals and passions led him to Silverline Tutoring. After applying for a
                            tutoring position at Silverline, Hassan was given the opportunity to become marketing head. His experience in DECA, a
                            business club at his school, helped him gain this position at Silverline. Aside from placing first at DECA states and
                            qualifying for internationals, Hassans passion for debate and public speaking, qualifying for nationals, and placing at
                            multiple national tournaments also helped him climb the ranks at Silverline to become marketing head. Hassans position
                            at his local mosque where he helps plan and organize events, as well as manage finances, also helps him perform his job
                            effectively and efficiently at Silverline.</p>

                    <p>Hi, my name is Abdul and I am a high school junior from South Florida. I have been a tutor with Silverline for about two
                    years, helping students with subjects like high school biology & chemistry, as well as economics, algebra, and
                    trigonometry. I am passionate about tutoring because I love to see others succeed. To me, Silverline Tutoring is an
                    organization in which any student can grow and develop, and playing a role in this as a tutor is truly inspiring.</p>

                    <p>Ashton is a freshman at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for Aerospace Engineering. He has always found that the
                    biggest obstacle in learning to be contextualizing concepts, and figure out how ideas fit in with real life. At this
                    point, Ashton has been with Silverline for over a year, and tutors programming through Python and Rust, general computer
                    science ideas, and any math below calculus 2. Ashton is a big believer in the idea that programming and math are
                    subjects that people either expressly love or hate: People are never taught the ideas behind the formulation and
                    routines they learn. Ashton hopes to help students find and understand those bigger ideas, and hopefully gain a deeper
                    appreciation for topics that can be very useful in the modern world.</p>
