                                Executive Officer</h6>
                            <p>Rishi Ajmera is currently a high school senior from Eastern Massachusetts. Rishi’s
                                initiative and concern about the
                                barriers and inequality within education led him to found and run the organization.
                                Rishi’s passion stemmed from his
                                keen interests in math and his private tutoring sessions that he did within his local
                                community. He taught students as
                                young as pre- k all the way till 8th grade, ranging from basic addition and abstraction
                                to SAT math problems. Seeing
                                students excited to learn and excelling in their subject as a result, left Rishi
                                satisfied and wanting to continue
                                teaching. However, he realized how many students don’t get the opportunity of private
                                tutoring often due to a multitude
                                of factors like cost. This led to him to create Silverline Tutoring, a non profit
                                organization that offers free tutoring
                                to everyone regardless of background. As for the experience on the business side of the
                                organization, Rishi has lots of
                                experience within this field. He competes in DECA, an international business
                                competition, and this year he competed in
                                the event, entrepreneurship, qualifying all the way to the international stage. The
                                previous year, Rishi competed in the
                                event, principles of marketing, and qualified for states. Rishi is the president of his
                                school's finance club as well
                                which focuses on many aspects of personal finance such as stocks. Rishi's experience
                                within business has allowed him to
                                excel in the business side of operations of the organization.</p>

                            <p>John Derham is currently a rising senior at the Perkiomen School in Pennsylvania. His passion for chess was what led him to eventually find Silverline Tutoring. Once he started playing Chess at the beginning of the COVID pandemic like many others, he wanted to connect with others online, and turned to discord, where he found Silverline Tutoring with the opportunity to tutor chess. There, he fell in love with the unique community and he took the opportunity to become COO in order to be able to make more positive changes in the community. One of the biggest changes he made was expanding the chess division and starting collaborations with other groups to host tournaments. In school, his favorite classes are Math and Physics. In his free time when he’s not hanging out with friends or working with Silverline, John likes to play chess and play the piano. He also runs track and plays tennis and soccer. For college, he hopes to join the US Air Force through their Academy/ROTC or get a degree in engineering. Currently, his top choices for college include the USAF Academy, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Rose Hulman.</p>

                                Technology Officer</h6>
                            <p>Tarun is currently a rising high school junior in Eastern Massachusetts. His interest in
                                tutoring as well as development allowed him to fit in at Silverline as the technology
                                head. Tarun’s passion in tutoring mainly came after running math workshops for the NSF
                                foundation where he taught 1st - 5th graders the basics of competition math in
                                anticipation of an upcoming exam. From such experiences, he was left with a rewarding
                                feeling that instilled his passion for teaching. Today, he continues to volunteer for
                                such organizations and works as a teacher. On the technology side, Tarun has been
                                featured on NBC Boston for his work in assisting small businesses in his area with web
                                applications. After the main wave of Covid-19, Tarun saw that smaller businesses were
                                severely disadvantaged and suffering. As a result, he started an initiative through a
                                social media campaign to attract small business owners. The post blew up, and in the
                                end, he assisted a total of 7 businesses in his area. Additionally, in the past, he’s
                                functioned as a junior developer for a startup called “Sujalam” that worked to provide
                                water tracking functionality to shrimp farmers. Specifically, he worked on app
                                authentication via Firebase. His years of experience in the computer science field and
                                passion for helping others have allowed him to thrive as the technology head of
                                Silverline Tutoring Services.</p>

                            <p>Anikait Singh is a current rising high school junior in Eastern Massachusetts. His passion for assisting charitable works and enjoyment of learning have helped him achieve the role of Chief Marketing Officer at Silverline Tutoring. Anikait’s passion for charity and assisting others came after he served as a summer volunteer at the Wish Project — a local charity based in Lowell, Massachusetts. The experience opened his eyes to a world of possibilities regarding charities and the ability for them to create communities of like-minded people functioning to better their individual surroundings. Realizing that he could also inspire betterment in his community, Anikait founded an initiative at his school which was aimed at integrating local charities into his high school. This initiative provided students to commit to organizations they believed in all within the school environment. He also worked with his tennis coach to set up summer sessions for younger kids interested in learning tennis and teach them the basics of the sport. His experience in marketing stems from working with government agencies to organize job fairs at his local high school for the coming school years.

His active participation and energetic attitude in both his school and neighboring communities has suited him as the Human Resources head for Silverline Tutoring. As a student who’s received tutoring himself, Shivam’s found that tutoring agencies often overprice their services and neglect to offer free resources that educated communities flourish and rely upon for academic success. As the Chief Human Resources Officer, Shivam communicates extensively with students and tutors to allow services to occur instantly, and serves to provide opportunities for students to take advantage of. During the school year, he leads his SkillsUSA club and competes at the world level for VEX Robotics. Through his collaboration with faculty and his team to prepare for competitions, he’s able to instantly connect with individuals across the globe, with everlasting discussions in politics, school, and life in general, always available to provide advice. Going forward, Shivam hopes that Silverline Tutoring’s services will be more accessible for students without the necessary technological means and is excited to see the up and coming developments. </p>

                                came at a young age when he struggled with speaking English at school. Hassans first
                                language was Gujarati, and when he
                                started school he didn't know how to communicate with others. However, with the help of
                                his parents and others around
                                him, he was left feeling fulfilled and confident in school and wanted to help others

                                debate to schools with less resources. These goals and passions led him to Silverline

When one of his friends and Chief Innovation Officer of Silverline Tutoring, Hassan, approached him for a position to lead social media at Silverline Tutoring, he gladly accepted in hopes to help spread the offer of tutoring to everyone regardless of background. In his everyday life, Luke enjoys lifting weights, playing video games like Valorant and Minecraft, reading, investing in stocks, as well as working at a local restaurant. As a new addition to the team, Luke is eager to work with others and spread the word about accessible tutoring, as well as learn more about social media and video editing skills.

                            <p>Lexi Leid is a third-year undergraduate student from Seattle studying event management. Although she is from the west coast, she attends school in the east within Southern Florida. Lexi decided to join Silverline Tutoring as a marketing intern to share her passion for content creation. The main factor that stood out to her was that Silverline offers free tutoring to any student struggling or looking for the potential to further gain learning skills across various course subjects. Lexi herself has learning disabilities. Therefore, she found it super essential to join alongside a community of tutors and students who share the same passion for teaching and helping each other regardless of academic difficulties due to learning differences. Lexi realized that “learning disabilities are not life disabilities; just because something is hard does not mean it is impossible.” Lexi always tells others how her story resembles a butterfly in that it is very similar. She, too, needed to spread her wings and overcome many barriers to get to where she needed to be.

Mihir joined Silverline Tutoring because of his passion towards tutoring and helping others achieve their goals. What made Silverline appealing to Mihir, was their initiative towards closing the education gap, and providing all students with free tutoring resources. This resonates deeply with him, because he’s seen first hand what happens when students lack adequate resources to learn. He became a marketing intern, because he’s always been curious and interested about marketing, and wants to gain more experience in the world of marketing. In school, he loves being the president of his school’s robotics and rocketry club. His passion for engineering in high school, has led him to plan to major in mechanical engineering in college.

In addition, he also volunteers and organizes events for his local library. He believes his years of tutoring experience, and passion will be able to help countless students.

                                Python and Rust, general computer
                                science ideas, and any math below calculus 2. Ashton is a big believer in the idea that
                                programming and math are
                                subjects that people either expressly love or hate: People are never taught the ideas
                                behind the formulation and
                                routines they learn. Ashton hopes to help students find and understand those bigger
                                ideas, and hopefully gain a deeper
                                appreciation for topics that can be very useful in the modern world.</p>

                            <p>Ronak is a high school junior in Texas. He enjoys prepping for debate and playing video games. Ronak has joined Silverline Tutoring to help students on their pathway through higher education, after seeing how much students can struggle in math concepts and tutoring high school students from failing to being in the top of their math class. He tutors math concepts all the way to algebra II as he has completed curriculum up to college algebra taken at the University of Texas at Austin. He hopes to one day become a doctor and is already working towards a degree. Ronak has just about a year of tutoring experience tutoring concepts from 7th grade math up to algebra II and is looking forward to reaching more students through Silverline.
